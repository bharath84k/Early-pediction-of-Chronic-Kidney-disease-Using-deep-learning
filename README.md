# Early-pediction-of-Chronic-Kidney-disease-Using-deep-learning
This project focuses on detecting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), primarily caused by diabetes and high blood pressure, using a deep learning model. The model, based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), achieves 96% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods and aiding in the early diagnosis and management of CKD.
